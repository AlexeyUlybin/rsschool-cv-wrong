###  Brief Info
I'm an architect (construction).
My goals are to find job which will give me interesting tasks and problems, 
so I could find some creative and graceful solution for them, and to make better my life/work balance. 
And i am curious about programming, what to learn more about it and to try it deeper, because it seemed interesting
and suddenly creative for me, when I tried it a little bit. 

### Skills and expirience 
No real skills and expirience at programming, just touched python and JS a little bit.

### Code example

JavaScript:
function multiply(a, b)
{
 return a * b
}
